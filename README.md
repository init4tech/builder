# The Signet Block Builder

The Builder is responsible for transactions through the Signet rollup, from ingestion and simulation to block construction and submission to Ethereum L1.

---

## üöÄ System Design

The Builder orchestrates a series of asynchronous actors that work together to:

1. **Env** - watches the latest host and rollup blocks to monitor gas rates and block updates.
2. **Cache** - polls bundle and transaction caches and adds them to the cache.
3. **Simulator** - simulates transactions against rollup state and block environment to build them into a cohesive block.
5. **Submit** - builds a blob transaction of the built block and sends it to Ethereum L1.
6. **Metrics** - records block and tx data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Requirements

- **Rust** ‚â• 1.85
- **AWS CLI**
- A private key or AWS KMS key for signing transactions

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t builder:latest .
   ```
2. Push to your container registry:
   ```bash
   docker push <registry>/builder:latest
   ```
3. Update your deployment manifests with the new image.
4. Verify expected behavior in your target network.
   - This should typically include sending a test transaction and verifying it is simulated and built into a block.
